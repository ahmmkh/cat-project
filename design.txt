- first check there is 2 mode 
stdin mode and file mode 

- file mode : 
    when detect more than one argument
-stdin mode : 
    when there is no argument provided 

if in file mode : 
    loop through every argument and perform the cat program in it 
if in stdin mode :
    take the input and then print it again

cat_program : 
    -open a file and save it's descriptor in an integer 
    -use that descriptor to read a chunk of the file accordding to the chunk storage
    varible 
    -after that read function will specify how many bytes it reads 
    - then use that value to write to the stdout stream easily as the size of the buffer
